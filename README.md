# Multi-Category Scene Recognition with CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into multiple scene categories.

## Project Overview

- Dataset consists of various scene categories (e.g., buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street).  
- Images are preprocessed and resized to a fixed size.  
- CNN architecture includes multiple Conv2D and MaxPooling layers, followed by Dense layers with dropout for regularization.  
- Model trained for 50 epochs achieving classification accuracy across multiple classes.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## How to Run

1. Install required libraries:  
2. Prepare the dataset with images organized by category folders.  
3. Run the training notebook or script.

## Results

The CNN model classifies scenes into six categories with good accuracy after training.
